## Introduction

This project is a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play against an AI opponent. The AI uses basic strategies to compete against you.

## Features

- Interactive console-based gameplay
- Simple AI opponent
- Clear and understandable code structure

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd tic-tac-toe
    ```

## Environment Setup

1. **Install Python:**
    - Download and install Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    - Follow the instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

2. **Verify the Installation:**
    - Open a terminal or command prompt.
    - Type `python --version` or `python3 --version` and press Enter to verify the installation. You should see the installed version of Python.

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):**
    - Navigate to the project directory:
        ```sh
        cd tic-tac-toe
        ```
    - Create a virtual environment:
        ```sh
        python -m venv venv
        ```
    - Activate the virtual environment:
        - **Windows:**
            ```sh
            venv\Scripts\activate
            ```
        - **macOS/Linux:**
            ```sh
            source venv/bin/activate
            ```

4. **Install Required Packages:**
    - Once the virtual environment is activated, install any required packages (if applicable) using pip:
        ```sh
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

## Usage

1. Run the game script:
    ```sh
    python tic_tac_toe.py
    ```
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game.

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- You are 'X', and the computer is 'O'.
- Players take turns to place their marks in empty spaces.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all 9 squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a tie.
